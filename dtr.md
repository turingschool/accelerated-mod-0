  <h3>Prepare to Engage</h3>
  <p>Whether you are starting your day with this activity or wrapping up a long day of technical work with this, take a moment to ground yourself in why you became a student at Turing. This Career Development work is arguably the most important component of your education that will lead you into your new career.</p>
  <p>Take a moment to reset if needed, meditate, or do some physical stretches/movement to get yourself into the space you need to be in to engage in this work. Some optional guiding questions follow.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why did you come to Turing?</li>
    <li>What is the thing that will motivate you to keep going on the days/weeks you feel <em>most</em> challenged at Turing?</li>
  </ul>

## Purpose

You will be a contributor in several paired/group project throughout your Turing career working on complex technical challenges. You may be surprised to find out that < 1% of failing projects at Turing are due solely to technical deficiencies - in fact, the majority of failing projects are due to intrapersonal/team issues. In order to set yourself (and your teammates) up for success, it is critical to clearly communicate and set expectations with your teammates. 

Before every project kickoff, we ask students to participate in a exercise known as **Defining the Relationship (DTR)**, where you will work to set realistic expectations with your teammates around workflow, communication, etc.

However, prior starting Mod 1, it is crucial for you to reflect on what works for YOU! Obviously, this will change over the course of your Turing career as your learn more about your strengths and weaknesses, which is why this will be used as a living document.

### Words of Wisdom

As you work through this document, avoid the following pitfalls:

- "I'm flexible!" or "I'm down for whatever the group wants to do!"
  - This is typically where problems start. You actually DO have preferences and opinions - it's better to communicate these from the get-go rather than have trouble come up later.
- "I can't really answer this until I start school"
  - Deciding on how you are going to show up as a teammate after you are in a working relationship with others does not always turn out so great. Push yourself to think through these relationships, dynamics, and your needs **now**.
  
## Preparing to DTR

You will learn a lot in between now and the first paired project you are assigned in Mod 1 - technical concepts, about yourself, and what working on technical projects collaboratively can look and feel like.

Start preparing for your first DTR conversation with a future project partner by <a href="https://gist.github.com/ameseee/0385f0fabb0438fd89e122352b7b2255" target="_blank">following the directions in this Gist</a> and submit your fork of it in the submission form.
