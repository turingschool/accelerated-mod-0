title: Pairing Session 2
---

## Learning Goals

- Get to know another classmate and collaborate on technical work
- Identify strengths and opportunities in oneself as a pair programmer
- Screen share, type in front of others, and communicate technical concepts

## Prepare

Before meeting with your partner, reflect on the following:
- What is one thing you are going to commit to doing, to be a great pair programmer today? 
- What is one thing you really need your partner to do to help you have an effective pairing session?

Be ready to share your answers with your partner.

## Mini-DTR

Spend a few minutes getting to know each other and discussing the questions you were asked to prepare answers to. This will help set expectations for what you each need and can commit to doing, and is an important habit to build when you start a working relationship. You'll be asked to reflect on both preparation questions (and how the session went in regards to those) after the pairing session.

Then, decide who will be the Driver and Navigator for the first challenge, then switch roles for the second exercise.

## Exercises

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Pairing Exercise 1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In your Mod 0 directory, reate a new directory called <code>pairing_2</code>. Inside of that directory, touch a file called <code>friends</code>. Initialize a Git repository</li>
    <li>Define a variable named <code>arrays</code> that stores an Array of 5 Strings with friends names.</li>
    <li>Write code to instruct Ruby to print the third element</li>
    <li>Write code to instruct Ruby to print the last element</li>
    <li>Write code to instruct Ruby to print the first element</li>
    <li>Run the file in the Terminal to verify your code is working as expected.</li>
    <li>Create a GitHub repository</li>
    <li>Push your work from the local repository to the remote repository</li>
    <li>Define another variable that stores an Array of 5 Strings, with names of places to visit</li>
    <li>Use one of the Array methods to do something to that new Array - you choose!</li>
    <li>Run the file in the Terminal to verify your code is working as expected</li>
    <li>Push that new work up to the remote repository</li>
  </ul>
