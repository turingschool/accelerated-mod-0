title: Pairing Session 4
---

## Learning Goals

- Get to know another classmate and collaborate on technical work
- Fluently screen share, type in front of others, and communicate technical concepts

## Prepare

Before meeting with your partner, identify 1-2 technical topics covered in Mod 0 that have been most challenging or interesting so far. Go back to those lessons and find a practice activity that you will Navigate for. Bookmark the link, or copy-and-paste the text in your notes app or a Slack DM to yourself; come prepared to the session ready to work on it!

## Mini-DTR

Spend a few minutes getting to know each other and sharing what you selected for your pairing exercise.

Then, decide who will Drive and who will Navigate first.

## Exercises

No exercises are provided as you each brought exercises to the pairing session!

## Reflection

There isn't a reflection for this pairing session specifically, but you will be asked to reflect on your experience and learning from the 4+ pairing sessions in your Final Reflection Video.
