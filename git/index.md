- Use Git to initialize a repository, add and commit changes, and check the status of changes

## Video

<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/bb896ed8eb5a44998331c581c250a12b" target="_blank">Watch this video</a>, and take notes throughout, to learn about the purpose of Git and see the workflow modeled several times. 

Stop at the provided prompts to take notes and complete practice exercises as instructed.

## Practice

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Exercise 1</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Navigate to your root directory.</li>
    <li>If you have a Turing and/or Mod 0 directory, navigate to that (highly recommended)!</li>
    <li>Create a new directory called <code>to_do</code>. Inside of that directory, create a file called <code>tasks.md</code>.</li>
    <li>Initialize Git inside of the <code>to_do</code> directory so that we have Git available to track changes.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Add <code>tasks.md</code> to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Make your first commit in this directory.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Use Atom to add three separate tasks to <code>tasks.md</code>.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Before you check the difference between your last commit and what the file looks like now, predict what it will say. Then, check the diff.</li>
    <li>Add the changes to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Commit the changes using a properly formatted commit message.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<br>

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Exercise 2</h3>
  <p>Before you run each Git command, pause and predict what the output, if any, will be.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new directory called <code>ruby_101</code>. Inside of that directory, create a file called <code>learning_ruby.md</code>.</li>
    <li>Initialize Git inside of the <code>ruby_101</code> directory so that we have Git available to track change.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Add <code>learning_ruby.md</code> to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Commit your work.</li>
    <li>In Atom, create a header and either a fact or question about Ruby in the  <code>ruby_101.md</code> file.</li>
    <li>Add the changes to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Commit the changes using a properly formatted commit message.</li>
    <li>Create a directory inside of <code>ruby_101</code> titled <code>practice</code>. Inside of that, create 3 files - you choose the names.</li>
    <li>Add some content to each of the three files inside the <code>practice</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Add and commit your changes.</li>
    <li>Check the status to ensure you have a clean working tree.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
