## Learning Goals

- Explain the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming
- Gain exposure and familiarity with the Ruby syntax for classes and object instances

## Vocabulary

- <span class="vocab">attribute</span>
- <span class="vocab">class</span>
- <span class="vocab">instance method</span>
- <span class="vocab">object instance</span>
- <span class="vocab">Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</span>

## What is OOP?

Back End Engineering is concerned with the management of data for an application. There are different ways we can structure the data itself as well as the systems that manage it. <span class="vocab">Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</span> is one way to design a program to manage the data in a Back End.

OOP is not exclusive to Ruby! In fact, many of the most widely used programming languages follow the patterns of OOP, including Java, C#, and Python.

## Connecting OOP to Real-World Scenarios

In the introduction, we shared that Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm for how we can organize code. Without seeing examples, that definition just feels‚Ä¶ unhelpful. In this section, we won‚Äôt dig into code quite yet, but we‚Äôll do some thinking and list-making to set ourselves up to write code in the next section!

### Car Factory

Let‚Äôs think about some components of a Ford car factory. We may make some stuff up, but this analogy should help us build context for what OOP is.
- The factory has a machine that is designed to make a Ford Escape
- All Ford Escapes have four wheels and four doors
- The color, interior fabric and engine size can vary from one Ford Escape to another

With the information above, in theory, the manager at the factory should be able to say ‚Äúplease make a blue Escape with a leather interior and 2.5 cylinder engine‚Äù, and that should be possible.

That example about the car factory ties directly to concepts of OOP. We will use three main technical terms today. They are below, with the connection to the car factory example:

- <span class="vocab">class</span> - A class is like a blueprint or template. The factory machines are designed to make a car - that is the template for ALL Ford Escapes. We could probably name it the `EscapeCar` class.
- <span class="vocab">object instance</span> - An instance is an object that is made from the class template. The blue Escape that the manager requested (and was able to physically sit in and drive) is referred to as an object or instance of the `EscapeCar` class.
- <span class="vocab">attribute</span> - An attribute is a specific characteristic about an instance that has the potential of varying from other instances. With our Escapes, color, interior and engine would be attributes, because they weren‚Äôt programmed into the template, but were extra information the manager was able to give for each specific instance of that class. The fact that the Escape has four wheels may also be an attribute; but it's not a dynamic attribute since all Escapes have four wheels.

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Brainstorm & Share</h3> 
  <p>Pick an object that you see in the physical space you are in. It could be a candle, water bottle, glove, anything!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What <em>type</em> of object is it? What might the class name be?</li>
    <li>Are there multiple objects/instances of it in your home, or in the world? List a few.</li>
    <li>What are some of its attributes?</li>
  </ul>

## Explore Class Syntax

While this may feel uncomfortable at first, research shows that one of the most effective ways to learn is to explore. Instead of your instructor typing code and explaining every character, you are going to read some Ruby code that's already been written. You will likely have some questions about what X or Y is doing, and you'll also likely be able to make some deductions about what other pieces are doing. We will talk through it all after you've had a chance to use your brain and make some connections on your own.

[Look at the code in this repl.it](https://replit.com/@turingschool/oop-intro-ford-escape#main.rb) and think through the guiding questions:

- What is the name of the class?
- How many instances are being made?
- What are the attributes? Which is a default attribute and which is dynamic?
- How might you make another _instance_?

Let‚Äôs discuss what you probably found and maybe had questions about.

## Write a New Class

In the previous section, you identified an object in your physical space and wrote a list of instances and attributes. The Navigator in this activity will direct their Driver to write a Ruby program that represents this object.

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Driver-Navigator</h3> 
  <p>The person with the largest number of characters in their name is the Driver, the other is the Navigator. The Navigator should have this document opened, and the Driver should be screensharing with their Terminal opened. The Navigator will direct the Driver through the steps listed below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a new project called <code>oop_lesson</code></li>
    <li>Inside the project, create a file called <code>first_class.rb</code></li>
    <li>Inside that file, write a class. Navigator - the class should represent the object your identified in your physical space. It does not yet need attirbutes, just the class name.</li>
    <li>Below the class declaration, create an object instance. Print it out and run the file to confirm it has been created successfully.</li>
    <li>Now, add a default attribute.</li>
    <li>Now, add a dynamic attribute. Remember, something about the object instance will need to change now that the class expects dynamic info.</li>
    <li>Run the file again to check for errors or issues. If you don't have any, create a few more object instances. Consider adding another dynamic attribute.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since the Navigator had to do all the talking, the Driver should practice articulating what this code does. 2-3 Drivers will be called on and expected to screen share and talk through the code when we come back together as a whole group.</p>
</div>

## Access Attributes

With the class you wrote in the previous activity try to print out _just_ one attribute. Does it work?

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Problem Solving</h3> 
  <p>Use the resource provided and work together to implement the <code>attr_reader</code>. Work to build an understanding of its utility.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-attrreader-in-ruby" target="blank">You'll need to allow read access with an <code>attr_reader</code></a> inside the class definition.</p>
</div>

## Instance Methods

Information, even when we include dynamic information, about an object is not always enough. In software engineering, we also want the ability to change information about an object. We will use instance methods to accomplish this.

<span class="vocab">Instance methods</span> are methods defined by the developer that can be called on any existing instance object of that class. What follows is an example to illustrate the syntax:

```ruby
class EscapeCar
  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
    @wheels = 4
    @gear = "park"
  end

  def change_gear(new_gear)
    @gear = newGear
  end
end

car1 = EscapeCar.new("blue")
p car1
car1.change_gear("drive")
p car1
```

As a class, we will discuss what this code is doing, and add to it! Be ready to take clear notes as every word we discuss isn't documented here in the lesson.

## Connection to Apps we Use

Now that you‚Äôve seen how this ‚Äúfactory‚Äù concept can be used in code, you may be wondering about how this code concept is used within apps we use every day.

We won‚Äôt get all the way there in illustrating it today, but, we can look at Instagram for a moment to talk through where we see some use of classes and instances.

## Build A Class with Specifications

Many times, you'll build a class based on specifications (commonly referred to as specs). They will usually be written in the form of tests, which we will learn about later. For now, use the specifications below to write a class and object instances from it. You should struggle a bit while completing this, but do your best and try _something_!

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Specifications</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li>In a new file, write a class called <code>Dino</code></li>
    <li>It should have a dynamic name attribute</li>
    <li>It should have a dynamic period attribute</li>
    <li>It should have a color attribute, that is green by default</li>
    <li>It should have a <code>roar</code> method that roars a sentence including its name, when called</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Challenge Extensions</h4> 
  <ul>
    <li>It should have a diet attribute that defaults to "vegetarian" <em>but</em>, if data is passed in, it can be dynamic</li>
    <li>It should have a <code>print_welcome</code> method that prints a sentence welcoming the Dino to the world. The welcome message should vary based on the period the Dino existed (Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous are examples).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Build Your Own Class

Now that we have an understanding of OOP and have used some Ruby syntax to write classes and create objects from them, we are ready to write a program that generates many instances of a class!

For this final section, you will choose the pace at which you want to work and the level of support you get. Read through the three options below and select the one you feel most comfortable and excited about:

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Mild üî•</h3> 
  <p>You will get starter code and some step-by-step directions that walk you through what to do and why you're doing it.</p>
  <p><a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/oop-mild-starter#main.rb">This is your starter kit.</a></p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Medium üî•üî•</h3> 
  <p>You will get some starter code and some direction on what to add to it, but will be pushed to apply all of today's learning without explicit direction at times.</p>
  <p><a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/oop-medium-starter#main.rb">This is your starter kit.</a></p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Spicy üî•üî•üî•</h3> 
  <p>You will not have any starter code for this option. Choose your own topic to make a class and instances of that class. There is no starter kit; create a new file on your own!</p>
</div>

## FYI: Storing Many Objects

If you‚Äôd like to print out all your sentences with one line of code, one way to do that is by storing them in an array. A couple changes were made from our original code in order to write this solution.

```ruby
class Message
  def initialize(recipient)
    @recipient = recipient
  end

  def create_message
    "To #{@recipient}: Hello!"
  end
end

mom = Message.new("Mom")
bff = Message.new("BFF")

messages = [
  mom.create_message,
  bff.create_message
]

puts messages
```

In OOP, it is common to store instances in a list, or array, like the one above. Consider a list of Instagram posts discussed earlier. It's likely Instagram stores all posts attached to each user profile in an Array.
