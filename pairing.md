## Learning Goals

- Explain the Driver Navigator Pair Programming style
- Identify strengths and opportunities when observing others pair program
- Identify strengths and opportunities in oneself as a pair programmer
- Become comfortable screen sharing, typing in front of others, and communication technical concepts

## Vocabulary

- <span class="vocab">Driver</span>
- <span class="vocab">Navigator</span>
- <span class="vocab">Pairing</span>
- <span class="vocab">Pair Programming</span>

## Pair Programming

<span class="vocab">Pair Programming</span> is a technique in which two software developers work together on a problem. We commonly refer to it as <span class="vocab">Pairing</span>. The concept of pairing comes from the Agile Methodology, which you'll learn more about during your time at Turing.

## Driver Navigator

There are many styles of pairing. In Mod 0, we will introduce and focus on the Driver Navigator style. In this style of pairing, the person determined to be the <span class="vocab">Driver</span> should screenshare and type all work the pair does. The <span class="vocab">Navigator</span> is responsible for doing the problem-solving and communicating to the Driver what they should be typing.

### Example

insert video of KVG and Amy Pairing

Answer the following questions while or after watching the video:
- What did Amy do blah
- What did Kaitlyn do?
- Something to hit on the fact they were both present
- Something to hit on the fact they switched roles very quickly
- Something to hit on - we make mistakes, and it's ok

## Tools

While at Turing, you will have two tools available for remote pairing: **Zoom** and **Tuple**. In Mod 0, we will primarily use Zoom. In Mod 1, you will get access to Tuple. While there are many other tools available for use, we prefer students use the same set of tools, so no matter what combination of students we have in a group, everyone knows how to use the tools used. This is similar to what you'll see on the job, but the specific tools of choice will vary from company to company.

## Best Practices

While there is no "right" or "perfect" way to pair, there are some best practices that when followed, set the team up for success:
- The Driver should maximize the space available on the screen; hide the Dock, shortcuts bar in browser, and use the entire window. Ask the Navigator if they can see the font size in the Terminal and code editor.
- The Navigator should be specific, don't leave room for the Driver to make assumptions or have to guess what you mean.
- Norm on some things:
  - What you will work on and how long you will work before you take a break?
  - Should the driver interrupt with questions throughout, or save them to the end?
  - Be fully present. Neither Driver or Navigator should be checking Slack, their phones, or anything outside of work for the task at hand. Commit to checking those other things during breaks.
  - Switch Driver/Navigator roles frequently so both teammates get practice with both roles!

## Pairing Activities

To help you become comfortable with pairing in what may be a very new environment for you, you will have 4 pairing sessions, each with a different classmate. Before and after each session, you'll be asked to prepare and reflect which will support your growth and awareness of your growth.

- [Wednesday]({{ site.url }}/pairing_2)
- [Thursday]({{ site.url }}/pairing_3)
- [Friday]({{ site.url }}/pairing_4)

You can absolutely choose to scheduled additional pairing sessions!
